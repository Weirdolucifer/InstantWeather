									<h3><a href="#">The Analog Technique</a></h3>
									<p>The analog technique is a complex way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event that is expected to be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">History</a></h3>
									<p>It was not until the 20th century that advances in the understanding of atmospheric physics led to the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction. In 1922, English scientist Lewis Fry Richardson published "Weather Prediction By Numerical Process", after finding notes and derivations he worked on as an ambulance driver in World War I.</p>

									<h3><a href="#">Background</a></h3>
									<p>Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.</p>

										<h3>OpenWeatherMap API</h3>
										<p>Openweather is a small IT company, established in 2014 by a group of engineers and experts in Big Data, data processing, and satellite imagery processing. Our headquarters is in the UK, we have an office in the US, and the development team in Latvia (EU).</p>

										<h3>MVC Framework</h3>
										<p>AngularJS provides with a smooth Model View Control Architecture which is also very dynamic in nature.

As we know any application is build up from combining different modules together. These modules work with different logics. These are initialized differently from each other. But still, these modules are connected with each other by some logic. The developers have to build all the components separately and then have to combine them together with some code and applied logic to fix them in a single application. This, of course, is an overhead for the developers while using an MVC Framework.

MVC makes it easier for developers to build client side web application. All the MVC elements which are developed separately are combined automatically using AngularJS Framework. There is no need for developers to write extra code to fit all the elements together. It allows you to put MVC element separately and automatically sets them together accordingly.</p>
									</li>
                                    <br>
									<li>
										<h3>SPA Architecture</h3>
										<p>A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. This approach avoids interruption of the user experience between successive pages, making the application behave more like a desktop application. Appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application.</p>
